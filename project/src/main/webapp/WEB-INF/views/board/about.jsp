<p>If you drew up a list of people likely to hate home-delivered meal kits like Blue Apron, Sara Moulton would be on it. She is one of the nation’s most enduring recipe writers and cooking teachers, a former food stylist for Julia Child and a dean of food television and magazines in her own right, whose new book is called “Home Cooking 101.”

But after two meal kit companies approached her to work with them, Ms. Moulton thought she should investigate. As for anyone who has been paying attention to home-cooking trends, it was hard not to be at least a little meal-kit curious. So she signed up.

“I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised,” she said, echoing the sentiment of many very good cooks who have taken the plunge and ordered a box. Ms. Moulton has not decided whether she’s going into business with one of the companies, but the kits gave her ideas for recipes. And the best part? She didn’t have to decide what to cook for dinner.

“Making dinner every night really wears thin,” she said. “You bore yourself. Even me.”

In the span of a few short years, more than 100 companies have jumped into the meal kit game. Millions of cardboard boxes arrive on urban and rural doorsteps every month, holding everything one needs to cook dinner, down to the rice wine vinegar and panko.

Ingredients are packaged in exact proportions, ready to be chopped or sautéed according to well-illustrated recipe cards. In less than an hour, even a mediocre cook with salt, pepper and cooking oil can produce an Instagram-worthy meal.</p>
